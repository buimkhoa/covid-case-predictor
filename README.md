### Problem

Corona virus (Covid-19) has been a pandemic for some time now. It was first identified in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province. It has a really fast transmission rate and itâ€™s very fatal. US and Brazil are among the countries with the highest confirmed cases. Lockdown has been implemented in various countries to slow down the spread of the disease, causing businesses to close and the economy to go down. Yet some countries do not implement lockdown and have a slower transmission rate than countries that do. It would be nice to know which is the most driving factor for transmission so we can focus on that instead of having full lockdowns.

### Solution

I will build a machine learning model to predict the number of confirmed cases for each country as well as answer the question as to which is the most driving factor for transmission.

### Specifications

The final deliverable is a web API deployed on AWS. System requirements are 4-core CPU and 8GB of RAM.

### Data

The data collected were all gathered from Kaggle. The main one is the confirmed cases from Covid19 global forecasting challenge. The rest are from other datasets with various country attributes, such as GDP, population, age, life expectancy, overweight, happiness score, etc.
